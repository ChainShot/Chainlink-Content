Awesome! Yes adding the functions is as simple as doing the following: 

```
    function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata /* checkData */) external override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory /* performData */) {
        upkeepNeeded = (block.timestamp - lastTimeStamp) > interval;
        // We don't use the checkData in this example. The checkData is defined when the Upkeep was registered.
    }

    function performUpkeep(bytes calldata /* performData */) external override {
        lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
        counter = counter + 1;
        // We don't use the performData in this example. The performData is generated by the Keeper's call to your checkUpkeep function
    } 

```

Amazing work! 

We now have the foundational features of Chainlink down... Let's move onto the cornerstone of how all these request and decentrality works, with making Chainlink API calls.
